# FractalsDiscovery
This package is a work in progress to provide some supporting software for the subjects presented at
<b>The Chaos Hypertextbook</b> (https://hypertextbook.com/chaos/) 
(The author of this package is not in any way associated with the Author of the book, though he is 
immensely grateful to him for having created it)
## Status
The project is also about refactoring some software about fractals developed in the past by me.
It's at an early stage, but it's progressing at a good speed.
I'll indicate here the progress for the various functionalities.
A release is planned for when they are going to reach a satisfying quality level.
