# FractalsDiscovery
This package is a work in progress to provide some supporting software for the subjects presented at
<b>The Chaos Hypertextbook</b> (https://hypertextbook.com/chaos/) 
(The author of this package is not in any way associated with the Author of the book, though he is 
immensely grateful to him for having created it)
## Status
The project is also about refactoring some software about fractals developed in the past by me.
It's at an early stage, but it's progressing at a good speed.
I'll indicate here the progress for the various functionalities.
A release is planned for when they are going to reach a satisfying quality level.
## 1.2 Experiments -> Bifurcation
The algorithm has been implemented and the images on the book generated. They are available in the folder <b> renderings -> bifurcation </b>
together with the xml files describing the parameters used to create the images.
Please note that FractalsDiscovery only generated data about the orbits. Images are rendered using other tols tools (like MATLAB)
Also, differently from the book the vertical axis for the images is oriented downwards.
